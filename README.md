# Tic Tac Toe No Draw

## Project Description

Tic Tac Toe No Draw is a unique implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, developed using React and Vite. In this version, the game prevents the possibility of a draw, ensuring that there is always a winner. This project showcases a creative twist on a traditional game, making it more challenging and engaging for players.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
